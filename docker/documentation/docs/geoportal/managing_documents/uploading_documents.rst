Uploading Documents
===================

GeoNode allows to share reports, conceptual notes, posters, spreadsheets, etc. A wide range of documents files can be hosted on the platform, including text files (.doc, .docx, .txt, .odt), spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx, .ods), presentations (.ppt, .pptx, .odp), images (.gif, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff), PDF, zip files (.rar, .zip, .gz), SLD, XML or QML files.

To open the *Documents Search* page click on :guilabel:`Documents` entry of :guialabel:`Geoportal` menu.

The :guilabel:`Upload Documents` button is on top of the page.
