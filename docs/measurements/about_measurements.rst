About Measurements
==================

A joint asset which could be exploited through fruitful cooperation is the
presence in the whole Adriatic-Ionian coastal territories of large networks of
sensors and stations. In the Adriatic region, we mapped 35 tide gauges (9 
inside the Venice Lagoon) and 9 wave stations, with the highest concentration 
in the northern Adriatic Sea.

The *Common Data Sharing System (CDSS)*  allows for aggregating the 
observed data from several monitoring network.
The aggregating approach for collecting and sharing observations is crucial for
providing real-time information about the sea state - and its evolution - to be
used by several countries for prompt emergency response and to increase the
overall preparedness to sea storms.

CDDS provides access to the stored resources through standardized interfaces (e.g OGC-Web service, web API). A core set of OGC web services and other protocols and standards commonly used
in the field of Atmospheric and Marine Sciences have be implemented:

 * OGC Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS, OGCI2005): standard interface to request and download geographical features across the web; 
 *  OGC Web Coverage Service (OGC-WCS, OGCI2008): standard interface to request and download coverages that is, digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena;
 *  OGC Sensor Observation Service (OGC-SOS, OGCI2012a): standard interface to request and download real-time sensor data and sensor data time series;
 *  OGC portrayal service (e.g. Web Map Service, OGCI2006; Tile Map  *  Service, OGCI2012b; Web  *  Map Tiling Service, OGCI2010): standard interfaces to visualize the geospatial datasets;
 * OGC Catalogue Service for the Web (CS-W; OGCI2007): standard for exposing a catalogue of geospatial resources;
 * Data Access Protocol (DAP; GPSHF2004): protocol designed for the efficient transmission of scientific data over the internet.

In addition, the Common Data Sharing System will implement dedicated I-STORMS
API for easily supporting IWS functionalities. Such API will follow the Open API
Specification (OAO2014).
