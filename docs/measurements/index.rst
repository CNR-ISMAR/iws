About Measurements
===============

A joint asset which could be exploited through fruitful cooperation is the
presence in the whole Adriatic-Ionian coastal territories of large networks of
sensors and stations. In the Adriatic region, we mapped 35 tide gauges (9 
inside the Venice Lagoon) and 9 wave stations, with the highest concentration 
in the northern Adriatic Sea.

The *Common Data Sharing System (CDSS)*  allows for aggregating the 
observed data from several monitoring network.
The aggregating approach for collecting and sharing observations is crucial for
providing real-time information about the sea state - and its evolution - to be
used by several countries for prompt emergency response and to increase the
overall preparedness to sea storms.
