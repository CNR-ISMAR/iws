About the Atlas
===============

All information on coastal disaster due to sea storm events (historical and
more recent) are organized and mapped in geospatial layers which constitute
the Sea Storms Atlas. That series can be used to draw the map of risk
characterization of the coast with the aim of identifying the most vulnerable
areas and supporting the planning of coastal area use and development.

The Sea Storm Atlas is presented in form of a map that summarize the Sea Storms Events occurred by region and/or by year, and an Event Catalog presented by several web pages. The Sea Storms Atlas is a dynamic repository and can be expanded and enriched anytime.
