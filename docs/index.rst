I-STORMS Web System Documentation
=================================

Welcome to I-STORMS Web System (IWS) Documentation.
IWS is a results of the `I-STORMS project <https://istorms.adrioninterreg.eu/>`_,
supported by the `Interreg ADRION programme
<https://www.adrioninterreg.eu>`_ funded under the European Regional Development 
Fund and IPA II fund.

In order to address the territorial challenges related to sea storms effects 
on the coastal areas, the I-STORMS project aims to develop a shared and 
interoperable system (I-STORMS Web integrated System - IWS) to allow a better 
exchange of information among partners and stakeholders in the Adriatic-Ionian area.

The IWS allows the public data, ocean forecast results and information about sea 
storms to be explored over the internet through the use of share
maps, dashboards, graphics, tables and other interactive geo-visualization tools.
IWS has been designed to foster the data dissemination in according to
the community-based paradigm and to the Open Data principles (i.e. open format,
open licensing), while respecting each countries' data policies.
