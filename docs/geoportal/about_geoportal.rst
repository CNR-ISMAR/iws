About the Geoportal
===============

The Geoportal identifies the end-user web interface of the IWS. The geoportal
provides interactive tools in order to search, visualize, explore and download
observation datasets and forecast outputs capitalizing on existing experiences in
the ADRION area (ADRIPLAN, SHAPE, HAZADR projects).
Two interactive geospatial and interactive GUI have  be developed:

 1. The Map Viewer and Composer  is an interactive and dedicated GUI for creating, managing and sharing multi-layered maps and for navigating and querying them. The complete list of supported functionalities is reported in Section “Map composer and map viewer”.
 2. Differently, the I-STORMS Interactive Viewer is a specialized GUI which offers a simultaneous visualization and exploration of multiple forecast model outputs and monitoring sensor networks time-series. The I-STORMS Interactive Viewer represents the more characteristic GUI of the IWS and supports Open I-STORMS and Sea Storm Atlas functionalities.
