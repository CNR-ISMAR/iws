About Open I-STORMS
-------------------

(measurements, ocean forecast results and information about sea storms) 
to be explored by non-experts over the internet. 
Overall, the `Open I-STORMS <http://www.seastorms.eu>`_ implements an advanced 
web mapping application to make accessible, through standard web browsers, 
geospatial and multi-temporal information on waves, sea level from both 
measurements sensor networks and forecast model output.
