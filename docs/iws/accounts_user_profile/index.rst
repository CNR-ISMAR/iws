Accounts and User Profile
=========================

The I-STORMS Web System provides many contents publicliy available: unregistered users have always read-only access to public maps, layers and documents.
In order to create maps, add layers or documents, edit the data and share these resources with other users, you need to sign in.

IWS/GeoNode is primarily a *social* platform, thus a primary component of the system is the user account. The IWS account are shared with the :ref:`open-istorms` and the :ref`mobile-app`.

This section will guide you through account registration, updating your account information and preferences, connections with social networks and email addresses.
