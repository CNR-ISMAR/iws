System - User interactions
===============

The structure of the I-STORMS Web integrated System has been proposed to serve
a very diverse number of users: project partners and associated partners, public
administrations in charge of management of coastal hazards/risks, scientific
researchers and institutions studying sea storms-related environmental
components, civil protection agencies, citizens.

The common data sharing system (CDSS) is be used by the project partners to
share their data (mainly on water level, waves and forecast model outputs). The
CDSS exclusively provides Web API and interoperable service interfaces and is
not intended to provide end-user GUIs.

The GUIs instead is exposed by the Geoportal which provides to all users an
easy way to access relevant information on surge storm in the Adriatic and Ionian
region (Sea Storm Atlas), .

The main users here are the project and associated partners, who access in an
integrated way the resources shared in the common sharing system, and public
administrations and stakeholders interested in the topic from informative and
management perspectives. These two categories will act as registered users.

The Open I-STORMS is be designed specifically for the general public, to
disseminate the output of the project through maps, dashboards, graphics, tables,
smartphone apps and other interactive geo-visualization tools.

Among registered users there are administrators that activate self-registered
users, create new users and configure how the system works.
